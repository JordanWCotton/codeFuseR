Website that allows users to dynamically create and execute HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This website allows the user to type and run html, adding css and js. It displays the output into an iframe in the 
results window. It is built using jquery and some fairly basic html/css work. It was meant as a learning project and
will be developed more over time. 




Current issues:
-The way that js is evaluated presents a security risk if ran on anything other than the file protocol. This website
in its current form should only be ran locally.

-Currently the website does not scale down to smaller screens smoothly, and will not display correctly on mobile 
devices.

-The coding windows do not allow the use of normal word processing functionality, such as the tab keys.



The above issues will be the first to be addressed, and more will be added as I revise this project.
